# MLW News - API.

Welcome to news API, this project allows me to pass through data to my front-end project. I have created specific end points to give the front end user more accessability to said data, whilst also protecting against any SQL injection. 

## Instructions

## Environment Setup

You will need to create two .env files, .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
